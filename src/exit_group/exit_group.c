NAME
       exit_group - exit all threads in a process

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/unistd.h>

       void exit_group(int status);

DESCRIPTION
       This system call is equivalent to exit(2) except that it terminates not
       only the calling thread, but  all  threads  in  the  calling  process's
       thread group.

RETURN VALUE
       This system call does not return.

VERSIONS
       This call is present since Linux 2.5.35.

CONFORMING TO
       This call is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Since glibc 2.3, this is the system call invoked when the exit(2) wrap‚Äê
       per function is called.

SEE ALSO
       exit(2)
