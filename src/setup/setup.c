SETUP(2)                   Linux Programmer's Manual                  SETUP(2)

NAME
       setup - setup devices and filesystems, mount root filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int setup(void);

DESCRIPTION
       setup()  is  called  once from within linux/init/main.c.  It calls ini‚Äê
       tialization functions for devices and filesystems configured  into  the
       kernel and then mounts the root filesystem.

       No  user  process  may  call setup().  Any user process, even a process
       with superuser permission, will receive EPERM.

RETURN VALUE
       setup() always returns -1 for a user process.

ERRORS
       EPERM  Always, for a user process.

VERSIONS
       Since Linux 2.1.121, no such function exists anymore.

CONFORMING TO
       This function is Linux-specific, and should not  be  used  in  programs
       intended to be portable, or indeed in any programs at all.

NOTES
       The  calling  sequence  varied:  at some times setup() has had a single
       argument void *BIOS and at other times a single argument int magic.
