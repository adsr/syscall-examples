NAME
       pciconfig_read, pciconfig_write, pciconfig_iobase - pci device informa‐
       tion handling

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pci.h>

       int pciconfig_read(unsigned long bus, unsigned long dfn,
                 unsigned long off, unsigned long len, void *buf);
       int pciconfig_write(unsigned long bus, unsigned long dfn,
                 unsigned long off, unsigned long len, void *buf);
       int pciconfig_iobase(long which, unsigned long bus,
                 unsigned long devfn);

DESCRIPTION
       Most of the interaction with PCI devices is already handled by the ker‐
       nel  PCI  layer,  and  thus  these calls should not normally need to be
       accessed from user space.

       pciconfig_read()
              Reads to buf from device dev at offset off value.

       pciconfig_write()
              Writes from buf to device dev at offset off value.

       pciconfig_iobase()
              You pass it a bus/devfn pair and  get  a  physical  address  for
              either  the  memory  offset  (for  things  like  prep,  this  is
              0xc0000000), the IO base for PIO cycles, or  the  ISA  holes  if
              any.

RETURN VALUE
       pciconfig_read()
              On  success,  zero  is  returned.   On error, -1 is returned and
              errno is set appropriately.

       pciconfig_write()
              On success, zero is returned.  On  error,  -1  is  returned  and
              errno is set appropriately.

       pciconfig_iobase()
              Returns information on locations of various I/O regions in phys‐
              ical memory according to the which value.  Values for which are:
              IOBASE_BRIDGE_NUMBER,  IOBASE_MEMORY,  IOBASE_IO, IOBASE_ISA_IO,
              IOBASE_ISA_MEM.

ERRORS
       EINVAL len  value  is  invalid.   This  does  not  apply   to   pcicon‐
              fig_iobase().

       EIO    I/O error.

       ENODEV For  pciconfig_iobase(),  "hose"  value  is NULL.  For the other
              calls, could not find a slot.

       ENOSYS The system has  not  implemented  these  calls  (CONFIG_PCI  not
              defined).

       EOPNOTSUPP
              This  return  value is valid only for pciconfig_iobase().  It is
              returned if the value for which is invalid.

       EPERM  User does not have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.  This does  not
              apply to pciconfig_iobase().

CONFORMING TO
       These calls are Linux-specific, available since Linux 2.0.26/2.1.11.
