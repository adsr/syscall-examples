SETFSUID(2)                Linux Programmer's Manual               SETFSUID(2)

NAME
       setfsuid - set user identity used for filesystem checks

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/fsuid.h>

       int setfsuid(uid_t fsuid);

DESCRIPTION
       The system call setfsuid() changes the value of the caller's filesystem
       user ID—the user ID that  the  Linux  kernel  uses  to  check  for  all
       accesses to the filesystem.  Normally, the value of the filesystem user
       ID will shadow the value of the effective user ID.  In  fact,  whenever
       the  effective  user ID is changed, the filesystem user ID will also be
       changed to the new value of the effective user ID.

       Explicit calls to setfsuid() and setfsgid(2) are usually used  only  by
       programs such as the Linux NFS server that need to change what user and
       group ID is used for file access without a corresponding change in  the
       real and effective user and group IDs.  A change in the normal user IDs
       for a program such as the NFS server is a security hole that can expose
       it to unwanted signals.  (But see below.)

       setfsuid() will succeed only if the caller is the superuser or if fsuid
       matches either the caller's real user ID, effective user ID, saved set-
       user-ID, or current filesystem user ID.

RETURN VALUE
       On  both success and failure, this call returns the previous filesystem
       user ID of the caller.

VERSIONS
       This system call is present in Linux since version 1.2.

CONFORMING TO
       setfsuid() is  Linux-specific  and  should  not  be  used  in  programs
       intended to be portable.

NOTES
       When glibc determines that the argument is not a valid user ID, it will
       return -1 and set errno to EINVAL without attempting the system call.

       At the time when this system call was  introduced,  one  process  could
       send a signal to another process with the same effective user ID.  This
       meant that if a privileged process changed its effective  user  ID  for
       the  purpose of file permission checking, then it could become vulnera‐
       ble to receiving signals sent by another  (unprivileged)  process  with
       the  same  user ID.  The filesystem user ID attribute was thus added to
       allow a process to change its user ID for the purposes of file  permis‐
       sion checking without at the same time becoming vulnerable to receiving
       unwanted signals.  Since Linux 2.0, signal permission handling is  dif‐
       ferent  (see kill(2)), with the result that a process change can change
       its effective user ID without being  vulnerable  to  receiving  signals
       from  unwanted  processes.   Thus,  setfsuid() is nowadays unneeded and
       should be avoided in new applications (likewise for setfsgid(2)).

       The original Linux setfsuid() system call supported  only  16-bit  user
       IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added setfsuid32() supporting 32-bit IDs.
       The glibc setfsuid() wrapper  function  transparently  deals  with  the
       variation across kernel versions.

BUGS
       No  error  indications  of any kind are returned to the caller, and the
       fact that both successful and unsuccessful calls return the same  value
       makes it impossible to directly determine whether the call succeeded or
       failed.  Instead, the caller must resort to looking at the return value
       from  a  further call such as setfsuid(-1) (which will always fail), in
       order to determine if  a  preceding  call  to  setfsuid()  changed  the
       filesystem  user  ID.  At the very least, EPERM should be returned when
       the call fails (because the caller lacks the CAP_SETUID capability).
