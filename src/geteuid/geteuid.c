GETUID(2)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 GETUID(2)

NAME
       getuid, geteuid - get user identity

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>
       #include <sys/types.h>

       uid_t getuid(void);
       uid_t geteuid(void);

DESCRIPTION
       getuid() returns the real user ID of the calling process.

       geteuid() returns the effective user ID of the calling process.

ERRORS
       These functions are always successful.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, 4.3BSD.

NOTES
   History
       In  UNIX V6  the  getuid()  call  returned  (euid << 8) + uid.  UNIX V7
       introduced separate calls getuid() and geteuid().

       The original Linux getuid() and geteuid() system calls  supported  only
       16-bit   user  IDs.   Subsequently,  Linux  2.4  added  getuid32()  and
       geteuid32(), supporting 32-bit IDs.  The glibc getuid()  and  geteuid()
       wrapper  functions transparently deal with the variations across kernel
       versions.
