NAME
       pause - wait for signal

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int pause(void);

DESCRIPTION
       pause()  causes the calling process (or thread) to sleep until a signal
       is delivered that either terminates the process or causes  the  invoca‚Äê
       tion of a signal-catching function.

RETURN VALUE
       pause()  returns  only when a signal was caught and the signal-catching
       function returned.  In this case, pause() returns -1, and errno is  set
       to EINTR.

ERRORS
       EINTR  a signal was caught and the signal-catching function returned.
