GETCPU(2)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 GETCPU(2)

NAME
       getcpu  -  determine  CPU  and NUMA node on which the calling thread is
       running

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/getcpu.h>

       int getcpu(unsigned *cpu, unsigned *node, struct getcpu_cache *tcache);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       The getcpu() system call identifies the processor and node on which the
       calling thread or process is currently running and writes them into the
       integers pointed to by the cpu and node arguments.  The processor is  a
       unique  small  integer  identifying  a CPU.  The node is a unique small
       identifier identifying a NUMA node.  When either cpu or  node  is  NULL
       nothing is written to the respective pointer.

       The  third  argument to this system call is nowadays unused, and should
       be specified as NULL unless portability to Linux 2.6.23 or  earlier  is
       required (see NOTES).

       The  information  placed in cpu is guaranteed to be current only at the
       time of the  call:  unless  the  CPU  affinity  has  been  fixed  using
       sched_setaffinity(2),  the  kernel  might  change  the CPU at any time.
       (Normally this does not happen because the scheduler tries to  minimize
       movements  between  CPUs  to keep caches hot, but it is possible.)  The
       caller must allow for the possibility that the information returned  in
       cpu and node is no longer current by the time the call returns.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success, 0 is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set
       appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT Arguments point outside the calling process's address space.

VERSIONS
       getcpu() was added in kernel 2.6.19 for x86_64 and i386.

CONFORMING TO
       getcpu() is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Linux makes a best effort to make this call as fast as  possible.   The
       intention  of  getcpu() is to allow programs to make optimizations with
       per-CPU data or for NUMA optimization.

       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call;  call  it  using
       syscall(2); or use sched_getcpu(3) instead.

       The  tcache argument is unused since Linux 2.6.24.  In earlier kernels,
       if this argument was non-NULL, then it specified a pointer to a caller-
       allocated  buffer  in  thread-local  storage that was used to provide a
       caching mechanism for getcpu().  Use of the cache could speed  getcpu()
       calls, at the cost that there was a very small chance that the returned
       information would be out of date.  The caching mechanism was considered
       to cause problems when migrating threads between CPUs, and so the argu‚Äê
       ment is now ignored.
