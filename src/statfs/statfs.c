STATFS(2)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 STATFS(2)

NAME
       statfs, fstatfs - get filesystem statistics

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/vfs.h>    /* or <sys/statfs.h> *|

       int statfs(const char *path, struct statfs *buf);
       int fstatfs(int fd, struct statfs *buf);

DESCRIPTION
       The  statfs()  system call returns information about a mounted filesys‐
       tem.  path is the pathname of any file within the  mounted  filesystem.
       buf  is  a  pointer to a statfs structure defined approximately as fol‐
       lows:

           struct statfs {
               __fsword_t f_type;    /* Type of filesystem (see below) *|
               __fsword_t f_bsize;   /* Optimal transfer block size *|
               fsblkcnt_t f_blocks;  /* Total data blocks in filesystem *|
               fsblkcnt_t f_bfree;   /* Free blocks in filesystem *|
               fsblkcnt_t f_bavail;  /* Free blocks available to
                                        unprivileged user *|
               fsfilcnt_t f_files;   /* Total file nodes in filesystem *|
               fsfilcnt_t f_ffree;   /* Free file nodes in filesystem *|
               fsid_t     f_fsid;    /* Filesystem ID *|
               __fsword_t f_namelen; /* Maximum length of filenames *|
               __fsword_t f_frsize;  /* Fragment size (since Linux 2.6) *|
               __fsword_t f_flags;   /* Mount flags of filesystem
                                        (since Linux 2.6.36) *|
               __fsword_t f_spare[xxx];
                               /* Padding bytes reserved for future use *|
           };

       Most    of     these     MAGIC     constants     are     defined     in
       /usr/include/linux/magic.h, and some are hardcoded in kernel sources.

       The f_flags is a bit mask indicating mount options for the file system.
       It contains zero or more of the following bits:

       ST_MANDLOCK
              Mandatory locking is permitted on the filesystem (see fcntl(2)).

       ST_NOATIME
              Do not update access times; see mount(2).

       ST_NODEV
              Disallow access to device special files on this filesystem.

       ST_NODIRATIME
              Do not update directory access times; see mount(2).

       ST_NOEXEC
              Execution of programs is disallowed on this filesystem.

       ST_NOSUID
              The set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are ignored by exec(3) for
              executable files on this filesystem

       ST_RDONLY
              This filesystem is mounted read-only.

       ST_RELATIME
              Update atime relative to mtime/ctime; see mount(2).

       ST_SYNCHRONOUS
              Writes  are  synched  to  the  filesystem  immediately  (see the
              description of O_SYNC in open(2)).

       Nobody knows what f_fsid is supposed to contain (but see below).

       Fields that are undefined for a particular filesystem are set to 0.

       fstatfs() returns the same information about an open file referenced by
       descriptor fd.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is
       set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES (statfs()) Search permission is denied for a  component  of  the
              path prefix of path.  (See also path_resolution(7).)

       EBADF  (fstatfs()) fd is not a valid open file descriptor.

       EFAULT buf or path points to an invalid address.

       EINTR  This call was interrupted by a signal.

       EIO    An I/O error occurred while reading from the filesystem.

       ELOOP  (statfs()) Too many symbolic links were encountered in translat‐
              ing path.

       ENAMETOOLONG
              (statfs()) path is too long.

       ENOENT (statfs()) The file referred to by path does not exist.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOSYS The filesystem does not support this call.

       ENOTDIR
              (statfs()) A component of the path  prefix  of  path  is  not  a
              directory.

       EOVERFLOW
              Some  values  were  too  large to be represented in the returned
              struct.

CONFORMING TO
       Linux-specific.  The Linux statfs() was inspired by the 4.4BSD one (but
       they do not use the same structure).

NOTES
       The  __fsword_t  type  used  for various fields in the statfs structure
       definition is a glibc internal type, not intended for public use.  This
       leaves  the  programmer  in a bit of a conundrum when trying to copy or
       compare  these  fields  to  local  variables  in  a   program.    Using
       unsigned int for such variables suffices on most systems.

       The  original  Linux  statfs()  and  fstatfs()  system  calls  were not
       designed with extremely large file sizes in mind.  Subsequently,  Linux
       2.6 added new statfs64() and fstatfs64() system calls that employ a new
       structure, statfs64.  The new structure contains the same fields as the
       original  statfs  structure,  but  the  sizes  of  various  fields  are
       increased, to accommodate large file sizes.   The  glibc  statfs()  and
       fstatfs()  wrapper functions transparently deal with the kernel differ‐
       ences.

       Some  systems  have  only  <sys/vfs.h>,   other   systems   also   have
       <sys/statfs.h>,  where  the  former  includes  the latter.  So it seems
       including the former is the best choice.

       LSB has deprecated the library calls statfs() and fstatfs()  and  tells
       us to use statvfs(2) and fstatvfs(2) instead.

   The f_fsid field
       Solaris,  Irix  and  POSIX have a system call statvfs(2) that returns a
       struct statvfs (defined in <sys/statvfs.h>) containing an unsigned long
       f_fsid.   Linux,  SunOS, HP-UX, 4.4BSD have a system call statfs() that
       returns a struct statfs (defined in <sys/vfs.h>)  containing  a  fsid_t
       f_fsid,  where  fsid_t  is defined as struct { int val[2]; }.  The same
       holds for FreeBSD, except that it uses the include file <sys/mount.h>.

       The general idea is that f_fsid contains some random  stuff  such  that
       the  pair (f_fsid,ino) uniquely determines a file.  Some operating sys‐
       tems use (a variation on) the device number, or the device number  com‐
       bined  with  the  filesystem  type.  Several operating systems restrict
       giving out the f_fsid field to the superuser  only  (and  zero  it  for
       unprivileged  users),  because  this field is used in the filehandle of
       the filesystem when NFS-exported, and giving it out is a security  con‐
       cern.

       Under  some operating systems, the fsid can be used as the second argu‐
       ment to the sysfs(2) system call.

BUGS
       From Linux 2.6.38 up to and including Linux 3.1, fstatfs() failed  with
       the error ENOSYS for file descriptors created by pipe(2).
