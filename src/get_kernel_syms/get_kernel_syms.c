GET_KERNEL_SYMS(2)         Linux Programmer's Manual        GET_KERNEL_SYMS(2)

NAME
       get_kernel_syms - retrieve exported kernel and module symbols

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/module.h>

       int get_kernel_syms(struct kernel_sym *table);

DESCRIPTION
       Note: This system call is present only in kernels before Linux 2.6.

       If  table  is  NULL,  get_kernel_syms()  returns  the number of symbols
       available for query.  Otherwise, it fills in a table of structures:

           struct kernel_sym {
               unsigned long value;
               char          name[60];
           };

       The symbols are interspersed with magic symbols of  the  form  #module-
       name with the kernel having an empty name.  The value associated with a
       symbol of this form is the address at which the module is loaded.

       The symbols exported from each module follow their magic module tag and
       the modules are returned in the reverse of the order in which they were
       loaded.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, returns the number of symbols copied to table.   On  error,
       -1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       There is only one possible error return:

       ENOSYS get_kernel_syms()  is  not supported in this version of the ker‚Äê
              nel.

VERSIONS
       This system call is present on Linux only up until kernel 2.4;  it  was
       removed in Linux 2.6.

CONFORMING TO
       get_kernel_syms() is Linux-specific.

BUGS
       There is no way to indicate the size of the buffer allocated for table.
       If symbols have been added to the kernel since the program queried  for
       the symbol table size, memory will be corrupted.

       The length of exported symbol names is limited to 59 characters.

       Because  of  these limitations, this system call is deprecated in favor
       of query_module(2) (which is itself nowadays  deprecated  in  favor  of
       other interfaces described on its manual page).
