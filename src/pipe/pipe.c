PIPE(2)                    Linux Programmer's Manual                   PIPE(2)

NAME
       pipe, pipe2 - create pipe

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       int pipe(int pipefd[2]);

       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) *|
       #include <fcntl.h>              /* Obtain O_* constant definitions *|
       #include <unistd.h>

       int pipe2(int pipefd[2], int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       pipe()  creates  a pipe, a unidirectional data channel that can be used
       for interprocess communication.  The array pipefd is used to return two
       file  descriptors  referring to the ends of the pipe.  pipefd[0] refers
       to the read end of the pipe.  pipefd[1] refers to the write end of  the
       pipe.   Data  written  to  the write end of the pipe is buffered by the
       kernel until it is read from the read end of  the  pipe.   For  further
       details, see pipe(7).

       If  flags is 0, then pipe2() is the same as pipe().  The following val‐
       ues can be bitwise ORed in flags to obtain different behavior:

       O_CLOEXEC
              Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag  on  the  two  new  file
              descriptors.   See  the  description of the same flag in open(2)
              for reasons why this may be useful.

       O_DIRECT (since Linux 3.4)
              Create a pipe that performs I/O in "packet" mode.  Each write(2)
              to  the  pipe  is  dealt with as a separate packet, and read(2)s
              from the pipe will read one packet at a time.  Note the  follow‐
              ing points:

              *  Writes  of  greater than PIPE_BUF bytes (see pipe(7)) will be
                 split  into  multiple  packets.   The  constant  PIPE_BUF  is
                 defined in <limits.h>.

              *  If a read(2) specifies a buffer size that is smaller than the
                 next packet, then the requested number of bytes are read, and
                 the  excess  bytes in the packet are discarded.  Specifying a
                 buffer size of  PIPE_BUF  will  be  sufficient  to  read  the
                 largest possible packets (see the previous point).

              *  Zero-length packets are not supported.  (A read(2) that spec‐
                 ifies a buffer size of zero is a no-op, and returns 0.)

              Older kernels that do not support this flag will  indicate  this
              via an EINVAL error.

       O_NONBLOCK
              Set  the  O_NONBLOCK  file  status flag on the two new open file
              descriptions.  Using this flag saves extra calls to fcntl(2)  to
              achieve the same result.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is
       set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT pipefd is not valid.

       EINVAL (pipe2()) Invalid value in flags.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has
              been reached.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been
              reached.

VERSIONS
       pipe2() was added to Linux in version 2.6.27; glibc support  is  avail‐
       able starting with version 2.9.

CONFORMING TO
       pipe(): POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008.

       pipe2() is Linux-specific.

EXAMPLE
       The  following  program  creates  a pipe, and then fork(2)s to create a
       child process; the child inherits a duplicate set of  file  descriptors
       that  refer  to  the same pipe.  After the fork(2), each process closes
       the descriptors that it doesn't need for the pipe (see  pipe(7)).   The
       parent  then  writes the string contained in the program's command-line
       argument to the pipe, and the child reads this string a byte at a  time
       from the pipe and echoes it on standard output.

           if (argc != 2) {
               fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <string>\n", argv[0]);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           if (pipe(pipefd) == -1) {
               perror("pipe");
