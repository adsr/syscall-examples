SIGRETURN(2)               Linux Programmer's Manual              SIGRETURN(2)

NAME
       sigreturn,  rt_sigreturn - return from signal handler and cleanup stack
       frame

SYNOPSIS
       int sigreturn(...);

DESCRIPTION
       If the Linux kernel determines that an unblocked signal is pending  for
       a  process,  then,  at  the  next  transition back to user mode in that
       process (e.g., upon return from a system call or when  the  process  is
       rescheduled  onto  the CPU), it saves various pieces of process context
       (processor status word, registers, signal mask, and signal  stack  set‐
       tings) into the user-space stack.

       The kernel also arranges that, during the transition back to user mode,
       the signal handler is called, and that, upon return from  the  handler,
       control  passes to a piece of user-space code commonly called the "sig‐
       nal trampoline".  The signal trampoline code in turn calls sigreturn().

       This sigreturn() call undoes  everything  that  was  done—changing  the
       process's  signal mask, switching signal stacks (see sigaltstack(2))—in
       order to invoke the signal handler.  It restores the  process's  signal
       mask,  switches  stacks,  and restores the process's context (processor
       flags and  registers,  including  the  stack  pointer  and  instruction
       pointer),  so  that the process resumes execution at the point where it
       was interrupted by the signal.

RETURN VALUE
       sigreturn() never returns.

CONFORMING TO
       Many UNIX-type systems have a sigreturn() system call or  near  equiva‐
       lent.  However, this call is not specified in POSIX, and details of its
       behavior vary across systems.

NOTES
       sigreturn() exists only to allow the implementation of signal handlers.
       It  should never be called directly.  Details of the arguments (if any)
       passed to sigreturn() vary depending on the architecture.

       Once upon a time, UNIX systems placed the signal trampoline  code  onto
       the  user stack.  Nowadays, pages of the user stack are protected so as
       to disallow code  execution.   Thus,  on  contemporary  Linux  systems,
       depending  on the architecture, the signal trampoline code lives either
       in the vdso(7) or in the C library.  In the latter case, the C  library
       supplies  the  location  of  the  trampoline code using the sa_restorer
       field of the sigaction structure that is passed  to  sigaction(2),  and
       sets the SA_RESTORER flag in the sa_flags field.

       The  saved process context information is placed in a ucontext_t struc‐
       ture (see <sys/ucontext.h>).  That structure is visible within the sig‐
       nal  handler  as  the  third argument of a handler established with the
       SA_SIGINFO flag.

       On some other UNIX systems, the operation of the signal trampoline dif‐
       fers a little.  In particular, on some systems, upon transitioning back
       to user mode, the kernel passes control to the trampoline (rather  than
       the  signal  handler), and the trampoline code calls the signal handler
       (and then calls sigreturn() once the handler returns).

   C library/kernel differences
       The original Linux system call was named  sigreturn().   However,  with
       the  addition  of  real-time  signals  in Linux 2.2, a new system call,
       rt_sigreturn() was added to support an enlarged sigset_t type.  The GNU
       C   library  hides  these  details  from  us,  transparently  employing
       rt_sigreturn() when the kernel provides it.
