READDIR(2)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                READDIR(2)

NAME
       readdir - read directory entry

SYNOPSIS
       int readdir(unsigned int fd, struct old_linux_dirent *dirp,
                   unsigned int count);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       This is not the function you are interested in.  Look at readdir(3) for
       the POSIX conforming C library interface.  This page documents the bare
       kernel system call interface, which is superseded by getdents(2).

       readdir()  reads  one  old_linux_dirent  structure  from  the directory
       referred to by the file descriptor fd into the  buffer  pointed  to  by
       dirp.   The  argument  count  is  ignored; at most one old_linux_dirent
       structure is read.

       The old_linux_dirent structure is declared as follows:

           struct old_linux_dirent {
               long  d_ino;              /* inode number *|
               off_t d_off;              /* offset to this old_linux_dirent *|
               unsigned short d_reclen;  /* length of this d_name *|
               char  d_name[NAME_MAX+1]; /* filename (null-terminated) *|
           }

       d_ino is an inode number.  d_off is the distance from the start of  the
       directory  to  this  old_linux_dirent.  d_reclen is the size of d_name,
       not counting the terminating null byte ('\0').  d_name is a null-termi‚Äê
       nated filename.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  1  is  returned.  On end of directory, 0 is returned.  On
       error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  Invalid file descriptor fd.

       EFAULT Argument points outside the calling process's address space.

       EINVAL Result buffer is too small.

       ENOENT No such directory.

       ENOTDIR
              File descriptor does not refer to a directory.

CONFORMING TO
       This system call is Linux-specific.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call;  call  it  using
       syscall(2).   You  will  need  to define the old_linux_dirent structure
       yourself.  However, probably you should use readdir(3) instead.

       This system call does not exist on x86-64.
