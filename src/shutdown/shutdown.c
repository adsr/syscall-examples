SHUTDOWN(2)                Linux Programmer's Manual               SHUTDOWN(2)

NAME
       shutdown - shut down part of a full-duplex connection

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/socket.h>

       int shutdown(int sockfd, int how);

DESCRIPTION
       The  shutdown()  call causes all or part of a full-duplex connection on
       the socket associated with sockfd to be shut down.  If how is  SHUT_RD,
       further  receptions  will  be  disallowed.   If how is SHUT_WR, further
       transmissions will be disallowed.  If how is SHUT_RDWR, further  recep‚Äê
       tions and transmissions will be disallowed.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is
       set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EBADF  sockfd is not a valid descriptor.

       EINVAL An invalid value was specified in how (but see BUGS).

       ENOTCONN
              The specified socket is not connected.

       ENOTSOCK
              The file descriptor sockfd does not refer to a socket.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001,  POSIX.1-2008,  4.4BSD  (shutdown()  first  appeared   in
       4.2BSD).

NOTES
       The  constants  SHUT_RD,  SHUT_WR,  SHUT_RDWR  have  the value 0, 1, 2,
       respectively, and are defined in <sys/socket.h> since glibc-2.1.91.

BUGS
       Checks for the validity of how are done in  domain-specific  code,  and
       before Linux 3.7 not all domains performed these checks.  Most notably,
       UNIX domain sockets simply ignored invalid values.   This  problem  was
       fixed for UNIX domain sockets in Linux 3.7.
